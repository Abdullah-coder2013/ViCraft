# ViCraft

ViCraft is a Minecraft clone updated from PyCraft
It has been compressed and reduced many blocks.
Now it is more lightweight and for better performance, we have reduced the size of the world.
It has now from 7 block unlike PyCraft which had 14 blocks!

# UnChangable Bugs

There are a few bugs that cannot be fixed, but there are ways to get around them.
First of all, there is a bug that when you jump in the void and quickly go forward, you will lay down in the ground. This is not actually a problem, but it is not supposed to happen.
Then the second bug is that you can't move/jump at the start of the game (this happens sometimes!). You must break a block and then place it again. Then you can move/jump.
The third "bug" is that when you stack blocks and you go very high, you can see the earth! This whole world is in a blue sphere Mesh. So, when you go very up you go outside the blue Mesh.
